        <p>Because I enjoy reading and love technology, I got an <a href="http://www.amazon.fr/dp/B0051QVF7A">Amazon
Kindle</a> for Christmas. So it has been
6 days and I can say: it is great; and that is the first reason I am writing
a blog post about it. The second is because I want to put my feedback online,
for people who would like another piece of information before buying it.</p>

<p>This blog post is not meant to be a detailed review of the Amazon Kindle:
I only deal with some points which are import ant to me. Also I almost do not
compare it with other ebook readers, because it has been done so many times and
because I do not have enough knowledge of the other readers.</p>
<h2 id="it-is-amazon">It is Amazon <a href="#it-is-amazon">»</a></h2>
<p>Being an Amazon product, it is obviously very well integrated with their store.</p>

<p>Some people say it is a major drawback: most of the books you buy through the
Kindle store are &quot;protected&quot; using DRMs (yet it seems like you can easily <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/01/how-to-strip-drm-from-kindle-e-books-and-others/">deal
with that
issue</a>,
never tested that though), so you cannot do whatever you want with that. It is
true, and I think we (readers) can all agree on the statement that they are
hateful <em>per se</em>.</p>

<p>However, when you buy an e-reader, you have two choices on that point: either
you buy an independent device (such as
a <a href="http://bookeen.com/en/cybook/odyssey">Cybook</a> by Bookeen) or a device sold
by a bookseller. In my opinion, the point is: on the one hand, if you buy the
device of a bookstore, you will be able to read the DRM-free books plus the
protected books sold by the company. On the other hand, on a device created by
an independent company, you will only be able to reader non-protected books. At
the end of the day, I am not sure you win by buying an independent ebook
reader.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> This is what I thought. However, after a talk with
<a href="http://twitter.com/brunobord">@brunobord</a>, I am now aware that independent
readers can also read DRM-protected books. My question is now: why can&#39;t my
kindle? Actually, my only try with a non-Amazon DRM-protected book was with
a document bought on iTunes. It may be an issue specific to iTunes DRMs. To be
investigated.</p>

<p>Now there is the Choice: Amazon, Apple&#39;s iTunes, Barnes and Noble and so on.
Which one? Well, I chooses Amazon because it is the place I usually buy my
paper books, and they have a tremendous collection.</p>
<h2 id="the-object">The object <a href="#the-object">»</a></h2>
<p>The pros and cons of the device itself have already been discussed in many
places, and I think my visible enjoyment  tells everything on my opinion on the
topic.</p>

<p>Yet I was afraid it would not &quot;feel right&quot; in the hand while reading, because
it is not as flexible as a paper book. However taking it in hand was really
intuitive and it works well.</p>

<p>In addition to this I would like to signal that it is important to me to also
buy a cover: the Kindle seems to feel dirty and scratched. It also just looks
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Marware-Atlas-Kindle-Touch-Cover/dp/B005HSG3JC/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1325324223&amp;sr=8-8">very
nice</a>.</p>
<h2 id="make-it-roar">Make it roar <a href="#make-it-roar">»</a></h2>
<p>When you register your Kindle online, Amazon creates you an @kindle.com email
address. You can then send emails with documents attached (PDFs, Word&#39;s DOC
files etc), with an optional subject of &quot;convert&quot;. This process will both store
the document on the Amazon website and send it to your device as soon as
possible (i.e. when you turn on the Wi-Fi). To my mind it is incredibly
powerful.</p>

<p>In fact, the first thing I did was to write a <a href="https://github.com/pelletier/dailykindle">Python
script</a> to send a Kindle book
(actually a MOBI file) built from a set of news feeds (RSS, atom). If you do
not quite understand: it delivers the news every week or day directly to your
kindle, for free.</p>

<p>People interested in this script, feel free to contact me if you have anything
to say about it!</p>
<h2 id="the-accents">The accents <a href="#the-accents">»</a></h2>
<p>As you&#39;ve probably noticed, I am not a native English speaker. Actually I am
French, which entails non-ASCII characters in almost every word. The problem
is: the Kindle seems to default to ASCII encoding. On books you buy, it is
obviously fine, but on self-made ones, you must be careful to specify the
encoding (it has a perfect support for UTF-8).</p>

<p>This problem hit me two times. The first one, when I wrote the first version of
DailyKindle. The second one is when I wanted to read a DRM-free book bought on
iTunes. Here is the little trick I used to fix the problem:</p>

<p>The file was an EPUB, so basically just a ZIP file in disguise. After
downloading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000234621">Kindlegen</a>
(a must-have for any Kindle hacker), I ran the following commands in an OS
X terminal:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>unzip mybook.epub -d mybook
perl -e <span class="s2">&quot;s/&lt;\/head&gt;/&lt;meta http-equiv=\&quot;Content-Type\&quot; content=\&quot;text\/html; charset=UTF-8\&quot; \/&gt;&lt;\/head&gt;/g;&quot;</span> -pi <span class="k">$(</span>find mybook/ -type f<span class="k">)</span>
<span class="nb">cd </span>mybook <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> zip -rTv9 ../mybook2.epub * <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="nb">cd</span> ..
kindlegen mybook2.epub
</pre>
</div>

<p>There it is: I had a fully working MOBI file. I just had to send it to my
Kindle email and I was ready to read.</p>

<p>This really irritated me: not defaulting to UTF-8 really is disgraceful.</p>
<h2 id="end-note">End note <a href="#end-note">»</a></h2>
<p>This is a really nice object and I really enjoy it. As shown, it has downsides,
but nothing one cannot deal with. I recommend it to any reader who is not
resistant to technology (which is really understandable).</p>
